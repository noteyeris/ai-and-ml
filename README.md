# My AI and Machine Learning Journey

In this repository, I will be following and logging my AI and Machine Learning journey. This will include:
- Resources such as:
  - Videos
  - Websites
  - Books
  - Etc...
- A log of everything I learned, day by day. As well as how I am planning to continue (maybe)

I will be creating separate repositories for every project I decide to take on.

## Books:
- Machine Learning with PyTorch and Scikit-Learn, Sebastian Raschka
- An Introduction to Neural Networks, Kevin Gurney
- Neural Networks from Scratch in Python, Harrison Kinsley
- An Introduction to Statistical Learning (with Applications in Python), Gareth James
